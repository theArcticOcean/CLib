This folder stores some C/C++ libraries and simple examples.
<li> sem.c: a simple semaphore using example.
<li> popen.c: a simple popen using example.
<li> myLocker: a multiple threads text encrypt tool. You can read its introduction for more details in its README.md
<li> threadFinishBySem.c: a semphore multi-threads example which makes sure some threads finished order by it's ID (0,1,2,3,...,9)
<li> pointerFun.cpp: a function pointer using example. It's very simple and easy to use.
<li> arrayExpand.cpp: a simple example which showes how to expand an array. Its solution was gotten from C++ STL::vector
<li> itoa.cpp:	my custom itoa function. It convert long long data to char *
<li> date_time.cpp: simple example that uses boost date type "date_time".
<li> boostSignal: some cases shows how to use boost's signals.
<li> boostBind: some cases shows how to use boost's bind.
<li> runtime_error.cpp: test what would happen if we catch exception or not after throwing runtime_error("a = 0!").
<li> stdPrinter.c: write() is C function without I/O buffer, we can use it and usleep to print more interestingly.
<li> DbusTest: Dbus using example based on GDbus (GLib)
<li> LambdaExpression: some cases of c plus plus lambda expresion.
<li> CCallBack.c: this is a simple C call back function using example.
<li> binary_function.cpp: use binary_function to write simple class to define self comparison function.
<li> VTKLearn: the folder contains some basic cases that for us to learn VTK, some cases use qt.
<li> MSVCLogprinter: the folder has example that provides logprinter to output log in file with MSVC.
<li> CPPDisableCopy: an example that ban to copy class object.
<li> ArchClip: an example that clip 3D model by plane based on VTK and Qt
<li> OpenCTM: some examples which use OpenCTM library to compress 3D mesh
<li> CheckFolderChange.cpp: use sha256 to check whether the files in folder are changed.
<li> UpdateJson.cpp: Change all picture's pathes, change them from Setting Data1/photo to Photo path
<li> AxisActor: show axis actor, three rings to rotate the cone.
<li> This is test line 2.
<li> ClipThreeRings: hide another half ring when rotate cone, this example is relevant to AxisActor
<li> vtkFactory: a simple example which show how to define my own vtk factory and use it to create instance.
<li> VTKLearn/CreateCurve: we can change the shape of curve and export it.
<li> VTKLearn/ConnectedEdgeList: find the longest connected edge list in the 3D Model By VTK
<li> VTKLearn/vtkSelectExplore: try to avoid 'can't follow edge' in vtkSelectPolyData
